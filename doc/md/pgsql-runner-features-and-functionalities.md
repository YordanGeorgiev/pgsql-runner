## 1. INTRO
This document presents the existing features and functionalities of this tool.

## 2. BASIC STDOUT, STDERR AND FILE LOGGING
The tool logs ( quite verbosely ) all its operations. The verbosity could be adjusted via the configuration file. 

### 2.1. Debug log output configurability 
You could turn off the doLog DEBUG calls output as [DEBUG] â€¦. If you disable it trough the configuration file. 

## 3. SUPPORT FOR LOGICAL ENVIRONMENTS
The tools "knows" the following 3 logical environments : 
dev
tst 
prd
Thus you can have different set / versions for your sql scripts for your dev , tst and prd databases.

### 3.1. Configurability of the logical environments
You could configure the codes of your logical environments in the configuration files.  

src/bash/pgsql-runner/pgsql-runner.dev.doc-pub-host.cnf
src/bash/pgsql-runner/pgsql-runner.tst.doc-pub-host.cnf
src/bash/pgsql-runner/pgsql-runner.prd.doc-pub-host.cnf

The tools has been tested with the following naming convention:
dev_&lt;&lt;db_name&gt;&gt; - the development database
tst_&lt;&lt;db_name&gt;&gt; - the testing database 
prd_&lt;&lt;db_name&gt;&gt; - the production database. 

## 4. CONFIGURABILITY


### 4.1. Per host configurability
You could have different host configurations in your deployment packages. 

### 4.2. Database names configurability
You configure different database names for your logical environments. 

## 5. POSTGRE SQL SCRIPTS RUN
This document presents the existing features of this tool

### 5.1. Initial create db sql script
You could add or remove the initial drop create db script in the following file:
src/sql/pgsql/dev_pgsql_runner/00.create-db.pgsql

### 5.2. Running sql scripts in files alphabetic order
The sql scripts are run in numeric order. Thus if you prefix the file names with 2 or 3 digit numbers the tool with run those according to the find . &lt;&lt;sql-dir&gt;&gt; | sort -nr command order. 

### 5.3. Logging sql scripts files run output to STDOUT , STDERR and a logfile
The tool will show you the output of each sql script file run and save it to a common log file ( configurable via the tool's configuration file ) 

### 5.4. Exit on sql script command fail
Should any of your sql script commands fail the tool with exit.

### 5.5. DOCUMENTATION
All the docs are stored in pdf and github md file format. 

#### 5.5.1. README


#### 5.5.2. DevOpsGuide
The DevOps guide provides the basic instructions on how-to setup the environment for the tool and basic PostgreSQL operations to speed up the tool's usage. 

#### 5.5.3. Features and Functionalities doc
This document.
